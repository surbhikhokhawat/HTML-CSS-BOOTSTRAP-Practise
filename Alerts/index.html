  <h1>Alert Messages through HTML and CSS</h1>
  <p>Some alert messages you always face:</p>
  <div class="alert">
    <h2>I have set this color to red as DANGER!</h2>
    <h3>I have set this color to green as SUCCESS!</h3>
    <h4>I have set this color to orange as WARNING!</h4>
    <h5>I have set this color to blue as HEADS UP!</h5>
    <p>These are few colors which we keep fix! In HTML , CSS we can change the colors.</p>
    <p>But further in Bootsrap, There are few in-built classes of alert-colors.</p>
    <p>That I will be covering in other folder.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <p>Click me to see an alert box on the window!</p>
  <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me!</button>
  <script>
    function myFunction() {
      alert("This is an alert box");
    }
  </script>
